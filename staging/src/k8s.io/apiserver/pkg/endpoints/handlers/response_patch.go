// For example, if the request is for /clusters/*/apis/kcp.io/v1/widgets, and it's a partial metadata request, the
// server returns ALL widgets, regardless of their API version. But because this is a partial metadata request, the
// API version of the returned object is always meta.k8s.io/$version (could be v1 or v1beta1). Any client needing to
// modify or delete the returned object must know its exact API version. Therefore, we set this annotation with the
// actual original API version of the object. Clients can use it when constructing dynamic clients to guarantee they
// are using the correct API version.
